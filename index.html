                <h1>Tadao Ando</h1>
                <p>The architect was born in 1941, in Osaka, Japan. He worked as a boxer and fighter before settling on the profession of architect, despite never having formal training in the field.
                    Struck by the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Imperial Hotel on a trip to Tokyo as a second-year high school student, he eventually decided to end his boxing career less than two years after graduating from high school to pursue architecture.
                    He attended night classes to learn drawing and took correspondence courses on interior design.
                    He visited buildings designed by renowned architects like <b>Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Louis Kahn</b> before returning to Osaka in 1968 to establish his own design studio, <b>Tadao Ando Architects and Associates.</b></p>
                    
                    <p>Ando was raised in Japan where the religion and style of life strongly influenced his architecture and design. Ando's architectural style is said to create a "haiku" effect, emphasizing nothingness and empty space to represent the beauty of simplicity.
                    He favors designing complex spatial circulation while maintaining the appearance of simplicity. A self-taught architect, he keeps his Japanese culture and language in mind while he travels around Europe for research. As an architect, he believes that architecture can change society, that "to change the dwelling is to change the city and to reform society"
                    In 1995, he won <b>the Pritzker Architecture Prize for the Nagaragawa Convention Center</b> in Japan. Tadao Ando's body of work is known for the creative use of natural light and for structures that follow natural forms of the landscape, rather than disturbing the landscape by making it conform to the constructed space of a building. Ando's buildings are often characterized by complex three-dimensional circulation paths. These paths weave in between interior and exterior spaces formed both inside large-scale geometric shapes and in the spaces between them.</p>

                            it is important as an element that provides the combination of the interior and the exterior. 
                            Providing the natural light inside is also an important feature.</li>
